The analysis presented in the master thesis titled Portfolio Optimization: Acknowledging the Practical Value of Markowitz's Theory has been based on the following notebooks:
Modeling Market Volatility_GARCH(1,1), Modeling Market Volatility_EWMA&VIX, Calculate Weights and Portfolio Analysis. 

Random Walk notebook has been considered but not included in the study since the primary focus was on minimum variance portfolios. The abstract of the paper is offered below, while the full access is available upon request. 

ABSTRACT 

DeMiguel, Garlappi and Uppal (2009) offer one of the most comprehensive studies of Modern Portfolio Theory, in which they analyze almost all relevant extensions of Markowitz’s rule and report that minimum variance technique tends to generate the best out of sample results. Nevertheless, none of the models covered in the research can consistently outperform a naive 1/N strategy. For this reason, they conclude that “there are still many miles to go before the gains promised by optimal portfolio choice can actually be realized out of sample”. The subsequent academic literature acts in accordance with this conclusion, however, the financial industry has already recognized the usefulness of Markowitz’s theory in practice. Namely, Markowitz’s minimum variance portfolio is a basis for an ETF (USMV) offered by iShares in 2011 that, as of 31st of March 2020, has more than $30 billion of net assets under management. Hence, we intend to supplement the academic literature and finally acknowledge the practical value of Markowitz’s theory. Accordingly, we extend the original study by DeMiguel, Garlappi and Uppal (2009) to include more sophisticated minimum variance models that could create superior risk-return properties than the naive 1/N strategy, regardless of the number or characteristic of assets included in the sample universe.
